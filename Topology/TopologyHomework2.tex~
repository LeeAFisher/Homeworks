\item Show that a space is simply connected if and only if all paths having the
same endpoints are fixed endpoint homotopic.

$\rightarrow$ Suppose $X$ is simply connected. Consider two points $x_0$ and 
$x_1$, and two paths $\alpha$ and $\beta$ connecting the points. We say 
$\bar{\beta}$ is $\beta(1-t)$. We can say that $[\alpha] \cong [\alpha] * 
[\bar{\beta} * \beta]$ because the path $[\bar{\beta} * \beta]$ is homotopic to
a constant path at $x_1$. Then by associativity we have $[\alpha] \cong [\alpha 
* \bar{\beta}] * [\beta]$. Next, because $[\alpha *\bar{\beta}]$ is a loop 
based at $x_0$ we have $[\alpha] \cong [1] * [\beta]$. Finally we get $[\alpha]
\cong [\beta]$ because $[1]$ is the identity. Thus $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are 
fixed endpoint homotopic.


$\leftarrow$ Suppose any two paths in $X$ are fixed end point homotopic. 
Consider a loop that begins and ends at the point $x_0$ and a path that is 
constant at $x_0$. These paths have the same endpoints so they are homotopic.
Thus any loop based at $x_0$ will be homotopic to the path that is constant at
$x_0$, and $X$ is by definition simply connected.
